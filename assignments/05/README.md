# Data Formats, Open Data, Tidy Data

In this exercise, you will be working with **Lord of the Rings** data. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data). 

1. Download and obtain the following CSV file: [`lotr_scripts.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data?select=lotr_scripts.csv). 
2. Document and describe the different data fields.
3. Identify "dirty" data fields and clean them up. Use regex replace, spreadsheets, OpenRefine or whatever you like. 
4. Document your working steps in a Markdown-formatted file. Export your dataset as a clean CSV file. Add both files to this repository (in this directory). 
5. Analyze the data set using shell scripts and/or regex. Document the commands in an additional section in your Markdown-formatted file.
